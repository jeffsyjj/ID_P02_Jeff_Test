# SneakersOfFame
My project is about providing sneaker botting services to help you cop the shoes that you want. People can get to keep up on latest and upcoming sneaker drops and learn about the services I am providing.

## Design Process
This website is mainly for sneakerheads who wants to cop all the latest heat shoe drops. It allows users who are intersted in sneakers to learn more about my service and why my service will be helpful for them when they want to get their hands on hot guaranteed sneaker drops. Members can login to gain access to the services. Non-members can also sign up for an account. About section tells the users who we are and the service section tell users about my website services.

## Features
Featuring my website features.
### Existing Features
- Navigation bar - Multiple navigation buttons to allow users to navigate within the website itself as well as one login button which navigates to another website. It stays at the top of the website when the user scrolls to ensure that users can navigate to different sections of the website instead of having to scroll all the way back up. For mobile, the navigation bar is a slider navigation bar. The animation effect is created using CSS.
- Buttons - Most buttons have cool gradient designs and links user to other websites. 
- Footer - Located at the very bottom of the page, footer contains my website rights as well as social media links where users can contact me. The 'SneakersOfFame' logo allows users to head back to the main page.
- Highlights - Using CSS, when a user hover their cursor over certain items, it changes the colour of the pointed items. For example, when hovering cursor over the navigation buttons, the button highlights into purple.
- Pop-up effect - Under my section cards, I used CSS to make my section cards have pop out effects.
- Login page - I created another html webpage for users to login or sign up to become a member.
- JavaScript - Javascript is used to make the mobile navigation slider effect. It is used to open and close the navigation mobile bar. Also, for mobile view=, Javascript is used to open the navigation bar menu and close the menu once the user clicks the navigation button and is lead to that particular section of the website. Javascript is also used such that when a user scrolls down the website on a non mobile view, the navigation buttons are highlighted which shows the users which part of the website they are at as they scrolled.
### Future features
- Login website - In the future, I can create a register member and forget member page for users.
